# More Functions and Nested Loops Project

This repository contains the solutions for the **more_functions_nested_loops** project at Holberton School. The project builds upon the foundational concepts of functions and loops in C, introducing more complex tasks and nested loop structures.

## üìù Project Overview

This project continues the exploration of **functions** and **nested loops** in C programming. It emphasizes more advanced problem-solving techniques using these concepts and introduces new challenges that require a deeper understanding of control flow and function usage.

### Key Concepts:
- **Functions**: Defining and using functions to encapsulate logic and make code reusable.
- **Nested Loops**: Utilizing loops within loops to handle multi-dimensional arrays and complex iteration patterns.
- **Modular Programming**: Breaking down problems into smaller functions to achieve more organized and maintainable code.

### Skills Gained:
- Applying nested loops for complex iteration scenarios.
- Writing more advanced functions to solve specific problems.
- Understanding how to optimize code using functions and loops in combination.

## üìÇ Project Structure

- **0-isupper.c**: A function that checks for uppercase characters.
- **1-isdigit.c**: A function that checks for a digit (`0` through `9`).
- **2-mul.c**: A function that multiplies two integers.
- **3-print_numbers.c**: A function that prints the numbers from `0` to `9`.
- **4-print_most_numbers.c**: A function that prints the numbers from `0` to `9`, excluding `2` and `4`.
- **5-more_numbers.c**: A function that prints 10 times the numbers from `0` to `14`.
- **6-print_line.c**: A function that draws a straight line in the terminal.
- **7-print_diagonal.c**: A function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal.
- **8-print_square.c**: A function that prints a square using the `#` character.
- **9-fizz_buzz.c**: A program that prints the numbers from `1` to `100`, replacing multiples of 3 with "Fizz", multiples of 5 with "Buzz", and multiples of both with "FizzBuzz".
- **10-print_triangle.c**: A function that prints a triangle using the `#` character.
