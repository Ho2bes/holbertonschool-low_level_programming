# 0x04. C - More Functions, More Nested Loops

## Description
This project continues the exploration of functions and nested loops in C. You will write more complex functions and practice using nested loops to perform tasks.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Write more advanced functions.
- Use nested loops to solve more complex problems.
- Use header files to separate code into modular units.

| `4-print_most_numbers.c`  | Prints numbers from 0 to 9, except for 2 and 4.                      |
| `5-more_numbers.c`        | Prints 10 times the numbers from 0 to 14.                            |
| `6-print_line.c`          | Draws a straight line in the terminal.                               |
| `7-print_diagonal.c`      | Draws a diagonal line in the terminal.                               |
| `8-print_square.c`        | Prints a square using `#` characters.                               |
| `9-fizz_buzz.c`           | Prints numbers from 1 to 100, replacing multiples of 3 with "Fizz", multiples of 5 with "Buzz", and multiples of both with "FizzBuzz". |
| `10-print_triangle.c`     | Prints a triangle using `#` characters.                             |
