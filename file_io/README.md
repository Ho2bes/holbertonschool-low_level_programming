# File I/O Project

This repository contains the solutions for the **file_io** project at Holberton School. The project focuses on understanding and implementing file input/output (I/O) operations in the C programming language.

## üìù Project Overview

File I/O operations allow programs to read from and write to files, enabling data persistence and interaction with external data sources. This project covers fundamental operations such as opening, reading, writing, and closing files, as well as error handling during these operations.

### Key Concepts:
- Using system calls such as `open`, `read`, `write`, and `close`.
- Managing file descriptors.
- Handling different file permissions and modes.
- Working with binary and text data in files.
  
### Skills Gained:
- Implementing file I/O operations in C.
- Understanding how to manipulate file descriptors.
- Handling errors and ensuring proper file management.
  
## üìÇ Project Structure

- **0-read_textfile.c**: A function that reads a text file and prints it to the POSIX standard output.
- **1-create_file.c**: A function that creates a file and writes text content to it.
- **2-append_text_to_file.c**: A function that appends text at the end of a file.
- **3-cp.c**: A program that copies the content of one file to another file.
