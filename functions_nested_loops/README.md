# Functions and Nested Loops Project

This repository contains the solutions for the **functions_nested_loops** project at Holberton School. The project focuses on mastering the concept of functions and how to use nested loops in the C programming language to solve problems efficiently.

## üìù Project Overview

In this project, you'll learn how to define and use functions, and how to create nested loops for repeated operations. Functions allow modular code and make it easier to handle repetitive tasks, while nested loops enable iteration over multi-dimensional data or perform complex operations multiple times.

### Key Concepts:
- **Functions**: Defining and using functions to modularize and reuse code.
- **Prototypes**: Declaring function prototypes for better organization.
- **Nested loops**: Using loops inside other loops to handle multiple iterations.
- **Scope**: Understanding local and global variables and how they behave in functions.

### Skills Gained:
- Writing custom functions and understanding function calls in C.
- Implementing nested loops to iterate over arrays and matrices.
- Managing the flow of a program with loops and function calls.

## üìÇ Project Structure

- **0-holberton.c**: A function that prints "Holberton", followed by a new line.
- **1-alphabet.c**: A function that prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.
- **2-print_alphabet_x10.c**: A function that prints the alphabet 10 times, each followed by a new line.
- **3-islower.c**: A function that checks for lowercase characters.
- **4-isalpha.c**: A function that checks for alphabetic characters.
- **5-sign.c**: A function that prints the sign of a number.
- **6-abs.c**: A function that computes the absolute value of an integer.
- **7-print_last_digit.c**: A function that prints the last digit of a number.
- **8-24_hours.c**: A function that prints every minute of the day, starting from 00:00 to 23:59.
- **9-times_table.c**: A function that prints the 9 times table, starting with 0.
- **10-add.c**: A function that adds two integers and returns the result.
- **11-print_to_98.c**: A function that prints all natural numbers from a given number to 98.
