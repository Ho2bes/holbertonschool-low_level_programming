# More malloc_free Project

This repository contains the solutions for the **more_malloc_free** project at Holberton School. The project expands on dynamic memory allocation in C, focusing on more advanced uses of `malloc`, `realloc`, and `free`.

## üìù Project Overview

Building upon basic dynamic memory allocation, this project delves into more complex scenarios where managing memory efficiently is crucial. The goal is to further develop skills in dynamic memory allocation, deallocation, and management to ensure optimized memory usage and avoid issues like memory leaks or fragmentation.

### Key Concepts:
- **malloc**: Allocating dynamic memory for various data types and sizes.
- **realloc**: Resizing existing memory blocks dynamically.
- **free**: Releasing dynamically allocated memory to avoid memory leaks.
- Working with different data structures such as arrays and strings in dynamically allocated memory.

### Skills Gained:
- Advanced use of dynamic memory allocation functions in C.
- Efficient memory management in complex data structures.
- Handling edge cases and errors during memory allocation and deallocation.

## üìÇ Project Structure

- **0-malloc_checked.c**: A function that allocates memory using `malloc` and checks for allocation failures.
- **1-string_nconcat.c**: A function that concatenates two strings, using dynamically allocated memory.
- **2-calloc.c**: A function that allocates memory for an array using `malloc` and initializes it to zero, similar to `calloc`.
- **3-array_range.c**: A function that creates an array of integers from a given range of values.
- **100-realloc.c**: A function that reallocates a memory block using `malloc` and `free`.
- **101-mul.c**: A program that multiplies two large numbers represented as strings.
