## Introduction

This repository is part of the curriculum at Holberton School, focusing on **low-level programming in C**. It contains a series of projects that are designed to teach the fundamentals of computer science, from basic syntax and structures in C to more advanced topics like memory allocation, file I/O, and linked lists.

Each project includes specific tasks and requirements, and they aim to build a strong foundation for systems-level programming and algorithmic thinking.

    Introduction to linked lists, including single and doubly linked lists.

18. **0x11-sorting_algorithms**  
    Implementation of various sorting algorithms.

19. **0x12-bit_manipulation**  
    Working with bits and bitwise operations.

20. **0x13-file_io**  
    Performing input/output operations on files in C.

## Learning Objectives

Upon completing these projects, you should be able to:

- Understand and apply basic and advanced concepts of C programming.
- Work with memory allocation and deallocation effectively.
- Implement and utilize data structures such as linked lists.
- Use recursion and function pointers in solving complex problems.
- Perform file I/O and manipulation of bits in C.
- Debug and troubleshoot C programs.
- Understand how the preprocessor and static libraries work.
  
## Requirements

- All code files should follow the **Betty style**.
- No global variables should be used.
- You are expected to test all programs using **gcc** with the following flags:
  
  ```bash
  gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
