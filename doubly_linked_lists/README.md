# Doubly Linked Lists Project

This repository contains the solutions for the **doubly_linked_lists** project at Holberton School. The project focuses on understanding and implementing doubly linked lists in the C programming language.

## 📝 Project Overview

A **doubly linked list** is a data structure where each node contains a data value and two pointers: one to the next node and one to the previous node. This allows for more efficient traversal in both directions compared to a singly linked list. This project covers how to implement, manipulate, and optimize operations on doubly linked lists.

### Key Concepts:
- Node structure with two pointers (`prev` and `next`).
- Dynamic memory allocation and management for nodes.
- Efficient insertion, deletion, and traversal of nodes in both directions.

### Skills Gained:
- Implementing doubly linked lists in C.
- Understanding how to manipulate nodes using both `prev` and `next` pointers.
- Gaining experience with dynamic memory allocation (`malloc`, `free`).
  
## 📂 Project Structure

- **0-print_dlistint.c**: A function that prints all the elements of a doubly linked list.
- **1-dlistint_len.c**: A function that returns the number of elements in a doubly linked list.
- **2-add_dnodeint.c**: A function that adds a new node at the beginning of a doubly linked list.
- **3-add_dnodeint_end.c**: A function that adds a new node at the end of a doubly linked list.
- **4-free_dlistint.c**: A function that frees a doubly linked list.
- **5-get_dnodeint_at_index.c**: A function that returns the nth node of a doubly linked list.
- **6-sum_dlistint.c**: A function that returns the sum of all the data (n) of a doubly linked list.
- **7-insert_dnodeint_at_index.c**: A function that inserts a new node at a given position in a doubly linked list.
- **8-delete_dnodeint_at_index.c**: A function that deletes the node at a given index in a doubly linked list.
