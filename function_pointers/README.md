# Function Pointers Project

This repository contains the solutions for the **function_pointers** project at Holberton School. The project focuses on understanding and utilizing function pointers in the C programming language.

## üìù Project Overview

**Function pointers** allow programs to store the address of a function in a pointer and invoke the function via the pointer. This concept is a powerful tool in C programming that enables more dynamic and flexible code, such as callback functions or switching between different behaviors at runtime.

### Key Concepts:
- Declaring and using function pointers.
- Passing function pointers as arguments to functions.
- Implementing callback functions using function pointers.
- Applying function pointers for modular and flexible program design.

### Skills Gained:
- Proficiency in using function pointers for dynamic function execution.
- Understanding how to pass functions as parameters.
- Exploring advanced concepts like callbacks and dynamic function dispatch.

## üìÇ Project Structure

- **0-print_name.c**: A function that prints a name using a function pointer.
- **1-array_iterator.c**: A function that executes a function given as a parameter on each element of an array.
- **2-int_index.c**: A function that searches for an integer in an array using a function pointer.
- **3-calc.h**: Header file defining prototypes for a simple calculator using function pointers.
- **3-op_functions.c**: Functions for basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) used by the calculator.
- **3-get_op_func.c**: A function that selects the correct operation to perform based on the user's input.
