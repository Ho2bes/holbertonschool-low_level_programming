# Singly Linked Lists Project

This repository contains the solutions for the **singly_linked_lists** project at Holberton School. The project focuses on understanding and implementing singly linked lists in the C programming language.

## üìù Project Overview

A **singly linked list** is a data structure in which each node contains a value and a pointer to the next node in the sequence. This project covers the implementation and manipulation of singly linked lists, a fundamental data structure used in various algorithms and applications.

### Key Concepts:
- **Nodes**: Each node contains a data field and a pointer to the next node.
- **Linked List Operations**: Insertion, deletion, and traversal of nodes in the list.
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: Use of `malloc` to allocate memory for nodes and `free` to deallocate memory when nodes are no longer needed.

### Skills Gained:
- Implementing basic singly linked list operations such as adding, removing, and traversing nodes.
- Managing dynamic memory in C using `malloc` and `free`.
- Understanding the structure and functionality of linked lists and how they differ from arrays.

## üìÇ Project Structure

- **0-print_list.c**: A function that prints all the elements of a singly linked list.
- **1-list_len.c**: A function that returns the number of elements in a singly linked list.
- **2-add_node.c**: A function that adds a new node at the beginning of a singly linked list.
- **3-add_node_end.c**: A function that adds a new node at the end of a singly linked list.
- **4-free_list.c**: A function that frees a singly linked list.
