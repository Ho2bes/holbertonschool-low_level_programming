# Pointers, Arrays, and Strings Project

This repository contains the solutions for the **pointers_arrays_strings** project at Holberton School. The project focuses on understanding how pointers, arrays, and strings work in C and how to manipulate them effectively.

## üìù Project Overview

In C programming, **pointers**, **arrays**, and **strings** are fundamental concepts that allow efficient manipulation of data in memory. This project covers how to use pointers to access and modify arrays and strings, along with deeper insights into memory management.

### Key Concepts:
- **Pointers**: Variables that store memory addresses and allow direct access to memory.
- **Arrays**: Contiguous blocks of memory that can be accessed and manipulated using pointers.
- **Strings**: Arrays of characters ending with a null terminator (`\0`).
- **Pointer arithmetic**: Understanding how pointers can be incremented or decremented to traverse arrays.
  
### Skills Gained:
- Using pointers to manipulate arrays and strings.
- Mastering pointer arithmetic for efficient memory traversal.
- Understanding string manipulation techniques in C.

## üìÇ Project Structure

- **0-reset_to_98.c**: A function that takes a pointer to an `int` as a parameter and updates the value it points to to `98`.
- **1-swap.c**: A function that swaps the values of two integers.
- **2-strlen.c**: A function that returns the length of a string.
- **3-puts.c**: A function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to the standard output.
- **4-print_rev.c**: A function that prints a string in reverse.
- **5-rev_string.c**: A function that reverses a string.
- **6-puts2.c**: A function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character.
- **7-puts_half.c**: A function that prints half of a string.
- **8-print_array.c**: A function that prints `n` elements of an array of integers.
- **9-strcpy.c**: A function that copies a string to another buffer.
