# 0x05. C - Pointers, Arrays, and Strings

## Description
This project introduces the concepts of pointers, arrays, and strings in C. You will learn how to manipulate memory and work with data stored in arrays.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Use pointers to access and manipulate memory.
- Work with arrays and strings.
- Perform arithmetic operations on pointers.
