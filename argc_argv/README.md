# argc_argv Project

This repository contains the solutions for the **argc_argv** project at Holberton School. The project focuses on understanding and handling command-line arguments in C, specifically the `argc` (argument count) and `argv` (argument vector) parameters passed to the `main` function.

## 📝 Project Overview

The project explores how programs can accept and process arguments passed through the command line. It includes several exercises and tasks that require students to write programs capable of handling different types and numbers of inputs.

### Key Concepts:
- **argc**: An integer that represents the number of arguments passed to the program, including the program's name.
- **argv**: An array of strings (character pointers) representing the actual arguments passed to the program.

### Skills Gained:
- Mastering the usage of `argc` and `argv` in C programs.
- Handling command-line input to develop more interactive and flexible applications.
- Error checking and input validation when dealing with command-line arguments.
  
## 📂 Project Structure

- **0-whatsmyname.c**: A program that prints its own name, followed by a new line.
- **1-args.c**: A program that prints the number of arguments passed to it.
- **2-args.c**: A program that prints all the arguments it receives.
- **3-mul.c**: A program that multiplies two numbers. If no arguments are provided, it prints an error.
- **4-add.c**: A program that adds positive numbers. If any argument contains a non-digit character, it prints an error.
- **100-change.c**: A program that prints the minimum number of coins to make change for an amount of money.
