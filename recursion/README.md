# Recursion Project

This repository contains the solutions for the **recursion** project at Holberton School. The project focuses on understanding and implementing recursive algorithms in the C programming language.

## üìù Project Overview

**Recursion** is a programming technique where a function calls itself in order to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller sub-problems. This project covers how to effectively use recursion in various scenarios, including solving problems like calculating factorials, generating Fibonacci sequences, and more.

### Key Concepts:
- **Recursive functions**: A function that calls itself to break a complex problem into smaller instances.
- **Base case and recursive case**: Identifying the termination condition and the recursive relationship in a problem.
- **Stack overflow**: Understanding the risks of recursion if the base case is not handled correctly or if the recursion depth is too deep.
  
### Skills Gained:
- Implementing and debugging recursive algorithms.
- Identifying suitable problems where recursion is more efficient than iteration.
- Optimizing recursive functions to avoid issues such as stack overflow.

## üìÇ Project Structure

- **0-puts_recursion.c**: A function that prints a string, followed by a new line using recursion.
- **1-print_rev_recursion.c**: A function that prints a string in reverse using recursion.
- **2-strlen_recursion.c**: A function that returns the length of a string using recursion.
- **3-factorial.c**: A function that returns the factorial of a given number using recursion.
- **4-pow_recursion.c**: A function that returns the value of `x` raised to the power of `y` using recursion.
- **5-sqrt_recursion.c**: A function that returns the natural square root of a number using recursion.
- **6-is_prime_number.c**: A function that checks if a number is a prime number using recursion.
- **100-is_palindrome.c**: A function that checks if a string is a palindrome using recursion.
- **101-wildcmp.c**: A function that compares two strings and returns `1` if the strings can be considered identical, using recursion.
