# Bit Manipulation Project

This repository contains the solutions for the **bit_manipulation** project at Holberton School. The project focuses on using bitwise operators to perform low-level operations on binary data in the C programming language.

## üìù Project Overview

Bit manipulation allows direct control over bits, which can optimize performance and memory usage in systems programming. This project covers fundamental operations such as setting, clearing, toggling, and checking specific bits in numbers.

### Key Concepts:
- Bitwise operators in C (`&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, `>>`).
- Understanding of binary representation and bit positions.
- Efficient manipulation of individual bits in data.
  
### Skills Gained:
- Working with bitwise operations to manipulate bits directly.
- Converting between decimal and binary.
- Applying bit manipulation techniques for performance-sensitive tasks.

## üìÇ Project Structure

- **0-binary_to_uint.c**: A function that converts a binary number represented as a string into an unsigned integer.
- **1-print_binary.c**: A function that prints the binary representation of a given unsigned long integer.
- **2-get_bit.c**: A function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.
- **3-set_bit.c**: A function that sets the value of a bit at a given index to `1`.
- **4-clear_bit.c**: A function that clears (sets to `0`) the value of a bit at a given index.
- **5-flip_bits.c**: A function that returns the number of bits needed to flip to convert one number to another.
- **100-get_endianness.c**: A function that checks the endianness of the system.
