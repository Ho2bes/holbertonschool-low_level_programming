# Hello World Project

This repository contains the solutions for the **hello_world** project at Holberton School. The project is an introduction to the C programming language, covering basic syntax, structure, and the process of compiling and executing C programs.

## üìù Project Overview

The **hello_world** project is the starting point for learning the C programming language. It introduces fundamental concepts like compiling with `gcc`, printing output with `printf`, and understanding the basic structure of a C program.

### Key Concepts:
- **Compiling**: Using `gcc` to compile C programs.
- **printf**: Printing output to the console.
- **C syntax**: Understanding the structure of a basic C program (including headers, `main` function, and return values).
- **Betty coding style**: Ensuring code adheres to the Betty style for readability and consistency.

### Skills Gained:
- Compiling and running C programs using `gcc`.
- Writing simple C programs that print output to the console.
- Understanding the basic structure of a C program and how to follow coding style guidelines.

## üìÇ Project Structure

- **0-preprocessor**: A script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and saves the result into another file.
- **1-compiler**: A script that compiles a C file but does not link.
- **2-assembler**: A script that generates the assembly code of a C file and saves it in an output file.
- **3-name**: A script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named `cisfun`.
- **4-puts.c**: A C program that prints a string using the `puts` function.
- **5-printf.c**: A C program that prints a string using the `printf` function.
- **6-size.c**: A C program that prints the size of various data types on the computer it is compiled and run on.
