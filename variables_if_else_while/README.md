# 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while

## Description
This project focuses on variables, conditionals, and loops in C programming. You will practice using `if`, `else`, `while`, and relational operators to create more complex programs.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Use variables of different types.
- Write and use `if` and `else` statements.
- Write and use loops (`while`, `for`).
- Understand and manipulate the ASCII character set.
