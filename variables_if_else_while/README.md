# Variables, if, else, while Project

This repository contains the solutions for the **variables_if_else_while** project at Holberton School. The project focuses on mastering basic control structures such as conditionals and loops, which are essential for controlling the flow of a C program.

## üìù Project Overview

This project covers fundamental programming concepts, including the use of variables, conditional statements (if/else), and loops (while). These concepts are crucial for writing logic that responds dynamically based on different inputs and conditions.

### Key Concepts:
- **Variables**: Declaring and initializing variables to store data.
- **if/else statements**: Using conditional statements to execute different blocks of code based on boolean expressions.
- **while loops**: Repeatedly executing a block of code while a condition is true.
- **Logical operators**: Combining multiple conditions using logical AND (`&&`), OR (`||`), and NOT (`!`).

### Skills Gained:
- Writing conditional logic using `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements.
- Using loops to iterate over data or repeat operations until a condition is met.
- Applying logical operators to build complex condition checks.

## üìÇ Project Structure

- **0-positive_or_negative.c**: A program that checks whether a randomly generated number is positive, negative, or zero.
- **1-last_digit.c**: A program that prints the last digit of a randomly generated number.
- **2-print_alphabet.c**: A program that prints the alphabet in lowercase using the `putchar` function.
- **3-print_alphabets.c**: A program that prints the alphabet in both lowercase and uppercase.
- **4-print_alphabet.c**: A program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, except for 'q' and 'e'.
- **5-print_numbers.c**: A program that prints all single-digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0.
- **6-print_numberz.c**: A program that prints all single-digit numbers of base 10 using the `putchar` function.
- **7-print_tebahpla.c**: A program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse.
- **8-print_base16.c**: A program that prints all numbers of base 16 in lowercase.
- **9-print_comb.c**: A program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers separated by commas.
